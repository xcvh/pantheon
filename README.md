## Getting started

### macOS

On macOS, this script will install `nix` using the
[Determinate Systems Nix installer](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/install) and
prompt to install my configuration.

> You'll need to run this script as sudo or have sudo permissions.

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xcvh/pantheon/main/install.sh)"
